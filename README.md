CMPE258 Deep learning project

Build models that can both classify facial expression and breed in animals

To run SVM and SENet, the dataset can be obtained online 

Pet facial expression: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/pets-facial-expression-dataset

Dog emotion: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devzohaib/dog-emotions-prediction/data

Dog breed: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikhushikhushi/dog-breed-image-dataset

How to run YOLOv8 model

Note: The YOLOv8 model runs on Google Colab environment, please upload it onto Google Colab. For the purpose of simplify the importing models step. We have save our original best.pt models into the 'results' subfolders in 'breed' and 'emotion' folders

Step 1: Extract 'CMPE258_Project.zip' on your local computer.

Step 2: Upload the whole folder onto your Google Drive.

Step 3: Go into the uploaded folder and open the 'YOLOv8_emotion.ipynb' and run it by all cells

Step 4: Similarly, open and run the 'YOLOv8_breed.ipynb' by all cells
